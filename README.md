To see the project refer to `Capstone_project.pdf` and `Capstone_Project.ipynb` files.

The project code are in `Capstone_project.py` and `visuals.py`.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

To see the project refer to `Capstone_project.pdf` and `Capstone Project.ipynb` files.

The project code are in `Capstone_project.py` and `visuals.py`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Higher-Education-Institutes-Ranking-Prediction/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Capstone Project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Capstone_Project.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

This study is inspired by Udacity's capstone project guidelines and uses the IPEDS dataset ([Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Delta Cost Project Database](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/deltacostproject/)), which is based on surveys on finance, enrollment, staffing, completions, and student aid of post-secondary education institutions within the US. 

For this project you need to download the following file:

1) [IPEDS Analytics: Delta Cost Project Database 1987-2012 (CSV) (109 MB)](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/deltacostproject/download/IPEDS_Analytics_DCP_87_12_CSV.zip)

And for more information on features of the datasets and its liberies, you can download the following files.
